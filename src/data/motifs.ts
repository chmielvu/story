/**
 * @file src/data/motifs.ts
 * @description Extendable library of visual motifs (Manara-esque and Narrative-specific).
 * Expanded based on "The Forge's Loom" codex, aesthetics of power and pain, and refactoring reports.
 * Incorporates themes of eroticized distress, systemic emasculation, ontological vertigo, and the Grammar of Suffering.
 * Motifs are calibrated for Neo-Noir / Milo Manara synthesis: clean ink lines, high-contrast negative space, liquid textures,
 * predatory female gaze, and symbolic inversion of virility (testis/testimony covenant).
 * New additions emphasize psychological horror, somatic betrayal, matriarchal inversion, and Baroque Brutalism elements.
